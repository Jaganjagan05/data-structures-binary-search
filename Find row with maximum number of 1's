Given a binary matrix (containing only 0 and 1) of order NxN. All rows are sorted already, We need to find the row number with the maximum number of 1s. Also, find the number of 1s in that row.
Note:

1. In case of a tie, print the smaller row number.
2. Row number should start from 0th index.

Example 1

Input:
N=3
mat[3][3] = {0, 0, 1, 
              0, 1, 1, 
              0, 0, 0}
Output:
Row number = 1
MaxCount = 2
Explanation:
Here, max number of 1s is in row number 1
and its count is 2.
Example 2

Input:
N=3
mat[3][3] = {1, 1, 1, 
              1, 1, 1, 
              0, 0, 0}
Output:
Row number = 0
MaxCount = 3
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. The task is to complete the function findMaxRow() which takes mat[][] as the 2D matrix and N as the size of matrix. Your task is to find the row number with the maximum number of 1s and find the number of 1s in that row and return the answer in a vector of size 2 where at 0th index will be the row number and at 1th index will be MaxCount.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 103
0 <= mat[][]<= 1

class Solution {
    public int[] findMaxRow(int mat[][], int N) {
        int maxOnes = 0; // Stores the max count of 1s
        int maxRow = 0;  // Stores the row index with max 1s

        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            int firstOneIndex = firstOneBinarySearch(mat[i], N);
            if (firstOneIndex != -1) { // If the row contains at least one '1'
                int countOnes = N - firstOneIndex; // Calculate number of 1s in this row
                if (countOnes > maxOnes) { // Update max count and row index
                    maxOnes = countOnes;
                    maxRow = i;
                }
            }
        }
        return new int[]{maxRow, maxOnes};
    }

    private int firstOneBinarySearch(int[] row, int N) {
        int left = 0, right = N - 1, result = -1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (row[mid] == 1) {
                result = mid; // Store first occurrence of 1
                right = mid - 1; // Search for an earlier 1
            } else {
                left = mid + 1; // Move right if we see a 0
            }
        }
        return result; // Returns -1 if no 1 is found
    }
}
