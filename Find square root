Given a positive integer n, find the square root of n. If n is not a perfect square, then return the floor value.

Floor value of any number is the greatest Integer which is less than or equal to that number

Examples:

Input: n = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: Since, 4 is a perfect square, so its square root is 2.
Input: n = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: Since, 11 is not a perfect square, floor of square root of 11 is 3.
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤  3 x 104
class Solution {
    long floorSqrt(long n) {
        long s=1;
        long end=n;
        while(s<=end){
            long mid=(long)(s+end)/2;
            if(mid*mid<=n){
                s=mid+1;
            }
            
            else{
                end=mid-1;
            }
        }
        return end;
        // Your code here
    }
}
